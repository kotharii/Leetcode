# Problem (link):- https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/description/

# TC - O(n) SC - O(n)

# My Note-
# 1- The question clearly gives the hint to use set since only then the duplicates are going to be removed automatically
# 2- TC - O(n) since using the set function will have to go through all the values of the nums list in order to see whats repeating
# and whats not atleast once. SC - O(n) in the worst case scenario there are not any duplicates and therefore the size of set will be
# the same as the size of the nums list and so the set will have n elements space required.

class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        return len(set(nums)) != len(nums)

# Solution Methods:-
    # 1- A naive approach where you simply put a pointer in the first place made a loop through the list
    # and went on until i found another element which is the same as the one already gone through and as soon as i found one i printed true
    # and if didnt find it even after traversing through the entire list then i printed false.

    # 2- Used set in python which helps eliminate duplicates afer this the length would just tell you if there were duplicates or not

# Thoughts on the Problem and Challenges:-
    # USAGE OF SET DATA STRUCTURE
    # FOR 2 REASONS THEY ARE GREAT TO USE HERE:
        # 1- it is a hash table data structure so to find the element is quicker
        # 2- it eliminates the duplicates for you in the first place.

# Learnings for a beginner in this problem:-
    # 1- sets are hash table data structures
    # 2- sets eliminates duplicate values for you
    # 3- set has various inbuilt functions like:
    # add, update, difference, remove, intersection, etc
