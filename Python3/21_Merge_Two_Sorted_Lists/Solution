# Problem (link):- https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/

# Notes-
# 1- Once you read the question, it is pretty straightforward to understand that it is just a game of pointers in order to reverse those pointers in order to get the
#  reversed list.
# 2- One should realize on his/her own that this can be done recursively too and try that too, because it was a bit challenging to think of it all in my head in
#  order to code it out.

# Solution 1: # TC - O(n+m) - this is becuase its  a linked list you will have to travel through all the elements once in order to do anything and so we do travel all
#  the nodes in the linked list in order to reverse them but in this case its only true in the worst case scenario, if there is a case where list 1 or 2 gets over really early then we
#  just provide the pointer to the other list and this saves us time going through that other list entierly. 
# SC - O(m+n) since we are creating a new node(using ListNode) every time when we want to add a node from the list1 or list2 because it is the correct node in the sorted list.

# Solution Methods:-
    # 1- In this solution I am traversing the linked lists and such that everytime i find a linkedlist element from either of the lists, then i create a new node and add it to a 
    # third list which contains of all the nodes in a sorted manner.
    # 2- This solution is exactly the same as above except for 2 things, 1- instead of creating a new node everytime it just updates the pointers which is obviously the main move that
    #  is imprtant as hell, and the second thing is the usage of the dummy node which really proves useful because it makes the code concise and easy to read.

# Thoughts on the Problem and Challenges:-
    # 1- This one mostly will be the second linked list problem that most of yall will be solving so here are a few properties to keep in mind which are very helpful:
        # i - the elements in a linked lists are not stored in contiguous locations in the memory, they are stored anywhere in memory and that is the reason we need a
        #  pointer from each node to the next node in order to know which element will occur next in the linked list.
        # ii - different from arrays in one way - you can increase and decrease the size in demand, for example in arrays if you defined it to be of size 4 then you
        #  cannot add a 5th element or remove an element from the 4 already in the array but in linked lists no matter that, you can always add a new elements and
        #  remove an elements which is present in the linked lists already. 
        # iii - an exmaple use case of linked list is a browser, where in a browser after having surfed and kept on clicking on multiple routing links that take you to
        #  multiple different pages, when you want to go a route link back you just click the back button feature that has been given by the browser, the browser
        #  maintains these route links in a linked list, they can use an array because they can predefine how many routing links will you be clicking on, so they will
        #  have to append the routing links as and when you are clicking on them(dynamically).
