# Notes- Remember whenever you have to find the sum/difference within a range of a list or any similar data structure especially multiple
#  times, it'll always be using Prefix sum/difference, cause making a prefix sum/difference makes it an O(1) operation to find the sum
#  since then the sum is just the subtraction of two numbers and the subtraction is just the addition of 2 numbers.


class Solution:
    def pivotIndex(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        for i in range(1, n):
            nums[i] = nums[i-1] + nums[i]
        total = nums[-1]
        for i in range(n):
            if i == 0:
                left = 0
            else:
                left = nums[i-1]

            right = total - nums[i]

            if left == right:
                return i
        return -1
