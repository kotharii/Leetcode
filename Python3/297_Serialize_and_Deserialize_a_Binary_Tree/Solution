# Problem (link):- https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/

# Notes-
# 1- In this question, for new people, serialization literally means nothing but to convert the data you have currently(for exmaple the tree they provided to you) to either string
#  format or binary representation, what binary representation means is if you convert the numbers into binary rep format (5 = 101) and then return this over the network so less
#  bandwidth and then are able to restore this structure from this string/binary representation that you passed.
# Try coming up with an iterative solution instead of recursive, Iterative > Recursive 

# Solution 1: # TC - O(n) - since we go through each node only once in both the serialize and deserialize functions so total operations would be 2n
# SC - O(n) - since in the worst case scenario the tree is entirely skewed and so the call stack can have n calls left within it both in serialize and deserialize function.
class Codec:
    def serialize(self, root):
        res = []
        def dfs(root):
            if not root:
                res.append("None")
                return
            res.append(str(root.val))
            dfs(root.left)
            dfs(root.right)
            return
        dfs(root)
        return ",".join(res)

    def deserialize(self, data):
        values = data.split(",")
        self.i = 0
        def dfs():
            if values[self.i] == "None":
                self.i += 1
                return None
            node = TreeNode(int(values[self.i]))
            self.i += 1
            node.left = dfs()
            node.right = dfs()
            return node
        return dfs()
    
# Solution Methods:-
    # 1- In this solution, we have first serialized the tree by following a simple preorder traversal and making sure that we convert this tree into a string format and so we have
    #  done that using simple dfs and then having received this string we have created a tree wusing the deserializa function.

# Thoughts on the Problem and Challenges:-
    # 1- It is difficult to come up with the deserialization function since to accomodate an incrementers along with a recursive function is challenging.

# Learnings for a beginner in this problem:-
    # 1- What is serialization
    # 2- what is deserialization
    # 3- How can one convert any DS into a single string or its Binary rep
